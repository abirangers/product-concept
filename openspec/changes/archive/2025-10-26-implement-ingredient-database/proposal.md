## Why

The AI Skincare Simulator requires a comprehensive ingredient database to provide scientific validation, safety information, and formulation guidance for skincare products. Currently, the database schema is defined but the ingredient management capabilities are not implemented. Users need to be able to search, filter, and select ingredients with detailed information including INCI names, effects, safety notes, concentration ranges, and scientific references.

## What Changes

- **ADDED** Ingredient management API endpoints for CRUD operations
- **ADDED** Ingredient search and filtering capabilities with full-text search
- **ADDED** Ingredient categories management with hierarchical organization
- **ADDED** Scientific references linking system for ingredient validation
- **ADDED** Ingredient factories and seeders for test data and initial population
- **ADDED** Comprehensive testing suite for ingredient functionality
- **ADDED** API resources for structured ingredient data responses
- **ADDED** Eloquent relationships between ingredients, categories, and references
