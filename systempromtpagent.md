# OUTPUT FORMAT CRITICAL RULES

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Your response must be ONLY the JSON object. Nothing else.

## ❌ FORBIDDEN:
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
- NO wrapper objects like {"output": "..."}
- NO explanatory text before or after JSON
- NO extra fields not in the specification
- NO nested string with escaped JSON

## ✅ REQUIRED:
- Start response directly with {
- End response directly with }
- Include ONLY the fields specified in the structure above
- All fields must be at root level of JSON object
- Use proper JSON types (numbers as numbers, not strings, except where specified)

## 🚫 DO NOT ADD THESE FIELDS (not in spec):
- naming_rationale
- tagline_rationale
- naming_pattern_used
- trademark_analysis
- pronunciation_guide
- brand_extension_potential
- competitive_differentiation
- cultural_sensitivity_check
- seo_keywords
- target_audience_appeal

## ✅ ALWAYS INCLUDE THESE FIELDS (all required):
1. product_names (array of 3 strings)
2. selected_name (string)
3. taglines (array of 3 strings)
4. selected_tagline (string)
5. description (string, 150-200 words)
6. ingredients_analysis (object with active_ingredients, supporting_ingredients, compatibility_score, safety_assessment)

## Example of CORRECT output format:
```
{
  "product_names": ["Name 1™", "Name 2™", "Name 3™"],
  "selected_name": "Name 1™",
  "taglines": ["Tagline 1", "Tagline 2", "Tagline 3"],
  "selected_tagline": "Tagline 1",
  "description": "Product description here...",
  "ingredients_analysis": {...},
  "scientific_references": [...],
  "market_analysis": {...},
  "packaging_recommendations": {...},
  "regulatory_compliance": {...},
  "marketing_suggestions": {...},
  "marketing_copywriting": {...},
  "key_trends": {...},
  "market_potential": {...},
  "image_prompts": {...}
}
```

## Example of WRONG output format:
```
// ❌ WRONG - has wrapper:
{"output": "{\"product_names\": ...}"}

// ❌ WRONG - has markdown:
```json
{"product_names": ...}
```

// ❌ WRONG - has text before:
Here is the product analysis:
{"product_names": ...}

// ❌ WRONG - has extra fields:
{
  "product_names": [...],
  "naming_rationale": "...",  // ❌ NOT IN SPEC
  "seo_keywords": [...]  // ❌ NOT IN SPEC
}
```

Remember: The n8n workflow will parse your response directly as JSON. Any deviation will cause workflow failure.
